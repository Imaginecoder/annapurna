Annapurna (goddess of food)
The anti-food waste app that lets you meet your neighbors

Why
We have noted that the two current challenges are the fight against food waste, in order to allow everyone to have enough to eat.
the other is the rise of intolerance and racism.
Because eating is a need that we all have, we wanted to create an annapurna application to allow everyone to offer a meal to a neighbor for free rather than throwing it away. Sharing a meal allows communities living in the same place to meet, while sharing a surplus by offering a meal to one of its neighbors.
Consat
Around the world, food is wasted at an enormous rate, of which many people are not aware. Greater than 30% of all food produced ends up being wasted, and almost all of that ends up in landfills. In addition to what is leftover on your plate that you don't consume, food is wasted at nearly every point between where it is produced and when it makes it to our plates; waste occurs during processing, handling, storage, transportation, and preparation. And this doesn't even include the inedible portions of the plants left in after the edible parts (e.g. tomatoes, bell peppers, Brussels sprouts, etc.) have been harvested. Collectively, cereals (grains) and vegetables make up approximately 50% of the food that gets wasted worldwide. In industrialized countries, the amount of cereals wasted annually is equivalent to over 750 BILLION boxes of pasta, and the amount of fruits and vegetables is equivalent to 3.7 TRILLION apples! Food waste is responsible for the production of approximately 135 million tons of greenhouse gases annually. Did you know that in terms of global carbon dioxide production, food waste is the NUMBER 3 contributor, behind China and the United States, and is more than double that of all ground transportation in the US?
the first place of wasters goes to individuals.
Yes we unwittingly waste and are responsible for 1/3 of food waste.
The covid crisis has also highlighted our need to create close social relations with our neighbors.
At a time when racism is a scourge in many countries, that communities are turning in on them.
The covid was an element that forced us to take care of each other and help each other between neighbors.
We wish to take advantage of this ecological awareness and this solidarity born during this crisis that we are going through to offer a digital tool to help citizens to share and meet with neighbors.
Annapurna is such the goddess of the same name to allow the safe giving and receiving of food while reaching out to the different communities who live in the same neighborhood.
Based on maslow's pyramid, we wanted to create an application that meets our primary needs, that of eating and socializing.
Initially Annapurna is based on a freemium model in order to grow its user community.
Secondly, once we have sufficient data, we will be able to publish and sell studies on the decrease in food waste among individuals and on the behavior of communities among themselves within a geographic territory (withdrawal or on the contrary opening and inter-community meetings) with companies or public authorities. Annapurna will also be able to make available to cities wishing to promote meetings between certain communities through meals by providing a SAas tool accessible on subscription and allowing municipalities to have reliable data on their campaign to fight against food waste and prevent food waste. racism or community withdrawal.
Allowing in the long term to be able to prevent intercommunity problems, but also to give aid to the territory with positive results, thanks to an integrated scoring.
